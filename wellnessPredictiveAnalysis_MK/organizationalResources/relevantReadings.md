[Downside of fitness trackers and health apps is loss of privacy](https://theconversation.com/downside-of-fitness-trackers-and-health-apps-is-loss-of-privacy-69870)

- Food, exercise, weight, blood sugar levels, medication reminders, sleep patterns, running routes, distances walked

- Datasets could be used/analyzed to identify negative behaviors associated to particular conditions (with a collection of different data)

- Ordering prescriptions using a mobile app provides information of medical conditions to the app, same with scheduling appointments online, home diagnostic kits, and online communication with health professionals

- Fitness trackers or apps are not currently approved for medical diagnosis

- With permission of a patient, physicians can be given access to fitness tracker/app accounts which can be used in medical decision-making

- Is it ethical for someone to have daily access to so much information about a patient, specifically information not directly connected to a condition?

- Strava is a fitness social media, which allows members to publish exercise routes, and connect with other individuals who are interested in specific fitness aspects (running, biking, etc.) in their area

- Strava Metro: Used information and data from Strava in order to bundle and sell anonymous data to public building departments (gives information about public fitness for future building)

- Third party cloud services are often used to hold fitness tracker/app data, which can be insecure

- Companies often sell or use wellness data for future research, though without giving the identity of the data, is this still ethical?

- Terms of app use include that data can be used by companies in many different ways, however users generally do not read all of the Terms and Conditions, does responsibility fall on the company or the user?

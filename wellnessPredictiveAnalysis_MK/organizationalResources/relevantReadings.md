### Basics of Fitness Tracking and Wellness Apps

[Downside of fitness trackers and health apps is loss of privacy](https://theconversation.com/downside-of-fitness-trackers-and-health-apps-is-loss-of-privacy-69870)

- Food, exercise, weight, blood sugar levels, medication reminders, sleep patterns, running routes, distances walked

- Datasets could be used/analyzed to identify negative behaviors associated to particular conditions (with a collection of different data)

- Ordering prescriptions using a mobile app provides information of medical conditions to the app, same with scheduling appointments online, home diagnostic kits, and online communication with health professionals

- Serious detectable health risks include: heart disease, atrial fibrillation, kidney disease, diabetes and cancer

- Heart disease: fitness trackers can detect irregular heartbeat and show an increase in a typical resting heart rate

- Atrial fibrillation: ECG feature of Apple watch tracks heart rhythym and can notice rhythym disorders

- Kidney disease, diabetes, cancer: Unexplained weight loss can by a symptom, fitness trackers can alert to this problem

- Fitness trackers or apps are not currently approved for medical diagnosis

- With permission of a patient, physicians can be given access to fitness tracker/app accounts which can be used in medical decision-making

- Is it ethical for someone to have daily access to so much information about a patient, specifically information not directly connected to a condition?

[The surprising ways your fitness data is really being used](https://www.outsideonline.com/2101566/surprising-ways-your-fitness-data-really-being-used)

- Strava is a fitness social media, which allows members to publish exercise routes, and connect with other individuals who are interested in specific fitness aspects (running, biking, etc.) in their area

- Strava Metro: Used information and data from Strava in order to bundle and sell anonymous data to public building departments (gives information about public fitness for future building)

[Use a fitness app to rack your workouts? Your data may not be as protected as you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2019/08/16/what-info-do-fitness-apps-keep-share/1940916001/)

- Third party cloud services are often used to hold fitness tracker/app data, which can be insecure

- Companies often sell or use wellness data for future research, though without giving the identity of the data, is this still ethical?

- Terms of app use include that data can be used by companies in many different ways, however users generally do not read all of the Terms and Conditions, does responsibility fall on the company or the user?

### Artificial Intelligence and Wellness

[The emerging artificial intelligence wellness landscape: Opportunities and areas of ethical debate](https://medium.com/@lkcyber/the-emerging-artificial-intelligence-wellness-landscape-802caf9638de)

- National Wellness Institute wellness perspective: Wellness is comprised of size dimensions, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, occupational, physical and social

- OECD wellness perspective: measure quality of life with health status, work-life balanca, education and skills, social connections, civic engagement, environmental quality, personal security, and subjective well-being

- Three mediums of AI in wellness: intangible, tangible, and embedded

- Intangible: no physical form, communicated through sound, notification, or running in background

- AI startup Mindstrong working to predict emotional health concerns before they arise by accessing phone use patterns when someone is relaxing/upset

- AI applications that are used as electronic "therapists"

- Tangible: AI in a physical form

- Sleep technologies which take environment factors and give feedback about sleep cycles and sleep quality

- Embedded: AI fused with out brain through invasive or non-invasive mechanism

- Brain computer interfaces still in process of being approved and created

[Predictive analytics in health care](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/analytics/predictive-analytics-health-care-value-risks.html)

- Predictive analytics: making predictions about unknown future events or activities that lead to decisions, evaluate historical and real-time data and make predictions about the future

- Enhance accuracy of diagnosis/treatment, and epidemiology to access public health risk factors

- Enable the use of prognostic analytics to allow doctors to find cures for certain diseases

- Examine large datasets (big data) and form predictions based on them

- Generate profiles of a community and health patterns with medical condition information, showing high smoking rates, high levels of obesity etc.

- Then gives insights for risk scores about a community

- Puts an impact on decision-making processes

- Problems with algorithm bias

- Privacy concerns - doctors are under pressure to combine care with data capture

[That mental health app might share your data without telling you](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/20/18508382/apps-mental-health-smoking-cessation-data-sharing-privacy-facebook-google-advertising)

- Only a fraction of apps disclose that they share data collected from their users

- Some apps sharing information with Facebook

- Lack of data security is a concern including health diaries, reports about individual substance use, and usernames

- Give third parties information about an individual's mental health

- University of New South Wales discovered that 92% of a 36 app study shared data with at least one third party (Facebook and Google-run services)

### Ethical Implications

[Ethical dimensions of using artifical intelligence in Health Care](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/ethical-dimensions-using-artificial-intelligence-health-care/2019-02)

- Threat to patient preference, safety and privacy

- There is a lack of policy guidelines for health/wellness artificial intelligence

- Though AI has the possibility of improving medical care tremendously, it is necessary to protect confidentiality, informed consent, and patietnt autonomy

- Should be integarated into future education

[Artificial intelligence in medicine raises legal and ethical concerns](https://theconversation.com/artificial-intelligence-in-medicine-raises-legal-and-ethical-concerns-122504#:~:text=AI%20can%20draw%20upon%20purchasing,information%20about%20an%20individual's%20health.&text=Researchers%20are%20already%20using%20AI,opioid%20abuse%20and%20even%20suicide.)

- Potential for discrimination, AI can use purchasing records, income data, and criminal records that can come with health record datasets

- AI to predict medical conditions including [heart disease](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/19/17027902/google-verily-ai-algorithm-eye-scan-heart-disease-cardiovascular-risk), [stroke](https://www.itnonline.com/content/fda-clears-first-ai-powered-clinical-decision-support-software-stroke), diabetes, and [cognitive decline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5880633/)

- Americans with Disabilites Act does not prohibit discrimination based on future medical problems (only current/past diagnoses)

- Need explansion of HIPAA Privacy Rule

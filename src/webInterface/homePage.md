### One in five adults living in the United States use fitness trackers and health-realted apps on a daily basis. With this continuously growing statistic arise ethical concerns of big data collection, and how fitness data can be used. Vigor is a tool which explores and shows the impacts of releasing personal data to health and exercise apps. With an artifical intelligence program, students will be able to choose what physical health data is accessible and then see what other medical information can be determined from these small pieces of recorded data. Physical health data will include heart rate, step count, minutes of activity, and minutes of rest as well as inlcuding possible other factors. Predicitive analytics are used in combination with connection to a medical database in the Python programming language for specific medical predictions according to small pieces of information. Vigor allows students to see how health and wellness data can be used, giving them the opportunity to understand and further discuss the ethics of releasing personal information to fitness trackers and health-related applications.

## Data Generation with Faker

Vigor utilizes a Python package called [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to generate appropriate health data and vitals based on personal information. Faker is an *extremely helpful* package, that is easy to install, understand, and use for general and customzied data generation. If you are interested in learning more about Faker, please choose the **Data Generation with Faker** menu option.

## Understanding Classification Algorithms

In order to accurately predict the health risks of an individual based on vitals and health data, Vigor uses machine learning classification. Vigor provides the opportunity to investigate and understand the three backbone classification algorithms, including *Naive Bayes*, *Decision Tree*, and *Support Vector Machine*. For more information on what classification is, and how each of these algorithms are written and work, please choose the **Understanding Classification Algorithms** menu option.

## Individual Health Analysis

Vigor is a tool that encompases creating accurate health data, and also interpreting those results in order to determine the specific health risks of an individual, with intentions of leading to ethical discussions about the usage of personal wellness information. This tool provides the opportunity to analyze and discuss both *provided*, and *customized* individual health data. In order to use Vigor, please choose the **Individual Health Analysis** menu option.

## Community Health Analysis

Currently, Vigor is a tool which only focuses on individual health data. In the future, we are hoping to expand this tool to work with data concerning an entire community, to investigate the health concerns of a large population of individuals. If you are interested in the progress of this tool element, please choose the **Community Health Analysis** menu option.

One in five adults living in the United States use fitness trackers and health-realted apps on a daily basis. With this continuously growing statistic arise ethical concerns of big data collection, and how fitness data can be used. Vigor is a tool which explores and shows the impacts of releasing personal data to health and exercise apps. With an artifical intelligence program, students will be able to choose what physical health data is accessible and then see what other medical information can be determined from these small pieces of recorded data. Physical health data will include heart rate, step count, minutes of activity, and minutes of rest as well as inlcuding possible other factors. Predicitive analytics are used in combination with connection to a medical database in the Python programming language for specific medical predictions according to small pieces of information. Vigor allows students to see how health and wellness data can be used, giving them the opportunity to understand and further discuss the ethics of releasing personal information to fitness trackers and health-related applications.

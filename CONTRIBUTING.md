## Testing

All testing for the Vigor tool is done using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), a framework which allows developers to write test cases for the Python programming langugage. For information on `pytest` please visit their [documentation.](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to misinformation](https://github.com/Allegheny-Mozilla-Fellows/misinformation) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://github.com/Allegheny-Mozilla-Fellows/misinformation/blob/master/pull_request_template.md)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). Please follow this customized [template](https://github.com/Allegheny-Mozilla-Fellows/predictiveWellness/blob/master/Development/pr_template.md) when creating a pull request for Vigor.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Vigor will generally not be accepted.

## Do you want to contribute to Vigor's documentation?

You can help improve the Vigor guides by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest  information.

To do so, make changes to Vigor's source files (located here on GitHub) or comments in source code. Then open a pull request to apply your changes to the master branch.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

Please email either Dr. Jumadinova or Madelyn Kapfhammer for any and all questions related to the Vigor tool.

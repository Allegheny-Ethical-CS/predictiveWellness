# Idea for database lab #1

- create a simple database

- Have an article about someone who displays their information (i.e., social media webpage)

- Have the students crack the database using root password (logging root password, common password, password auditing tool)

- Have the students display the information that they received/ How could they damage this person?

- In the reflection, talk about ethics of hacking
  - Just because you can do it, doesn't mean you should
  - reflect on experience of collecting someone else's information
  - do you think it's safe to put your information online?
  - how can you solve this puzzle/ add on to it?

# Customizing Synthetic Data

Welcome to the section of Vigor that allows you to create synthetic health data! Here, you are able to choose between both individual and community data generation. Individual data is created to simulate information regarding one person, and community data is created to simulate information regarding a group of people, such as a city, student population, or even country.

## Creating a CSV File

In order to use this function of Vigor please create a `.csv` file in directory/repository that you are interested in generating data for. This file **must** be a `.csv` file, but can be in any location, locally on your machine. For the best results, please create a single, labeled column in your `.csv` file called "Index".

Please input the file path into the existing textbox.

## Datapoint Selection

After inputting your file path, please select either _individual_ or _community_ data generation, and also input how much data you would like Vigor to produce for you **please note that the more data you request, the longer Vigor will take to run**. Depending on your data classification, please choose what datapoints that you would like to be generated.

## Data Generation

Vigor will then return a formatted version of your synthetic data, as well as input the customized, generated data into the earlier specified `.csv` file for future use!

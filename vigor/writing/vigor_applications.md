# Vigor's Predictive Wellness

## Understanding Classification Algorithms

In order to accurately predict the health risks of an individual based on vitals and health data, Vigor uses machine learning classification. Vigor provides the opportunity to investigate and understand the three backbone classification algorithms, including *Naive Bayes*, *Decision Tree*, and *Support Vector Machine*. For more information on what classification is, and how each of these algorithms are written and work, please choose the **Understanding Classification Algorithms** menu option.

## Individual Health Analysis

Vigor is a tool that encompases creating accurate health data, and also interpreting those results in order to determine the specific health risks of an individual, with intentions of leading to ethical discussions about the usage of personal wellness information. This tool provides the opportunity to analyze and discuss both *provided*, and *customized* individual health data. In order to use Vigor, please choose the **Individual Health Analysis** menu option.

## Community Health Analysis

Currently, Vigor is a tool which only focuses on individual health data. In the future, we are hoping to expand this tool to work with data concerning an entire community, to investigate the health concerns of a large population of individuals. If you are interested in the progress of this feature, please choose the **Community Health Analysis** menu option.

Increased morbidity and mortality is associated with older age, male gender, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and smoking. As COVID-19 spreads from coastal borders, both state to state and country to country, our understanding of its pathophysiology has evolved. Age and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) play especially important roles in COVID-19 progression. T2DM is an age-related disease associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and endothelial activation and dysfunction. This review evaluates the relationships and intersection between endothelial cell activation and dysfunction in T2DM and COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple injuries of the terminal bronchioles and alveolar blood-gas barrier and associated ultrastructural tissue remodeling. COVID-19 may unmask multiple vulnerabilities associated with T2DM including damage to the endothelial glycocalyx and multiple end-organ macro and microvascular diseases. Unmasking existing vulnerabilities in diabetic patients with COVID-19 is important. Globally, we must come together to better understand why T2DM is associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality."

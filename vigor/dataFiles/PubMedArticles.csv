Positioning statement of the Diabetes, Obesity and Nutrition Workgroup of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine (SEMI) for an approach centred on individuals with obesity.",,2020-07-30,32723530,,"Metabolic syndrome is defined as a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by insulin resistance, a predisposition to Type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic vascular disease. The changing hormonal milieu with altered estrogen and testosterone ratio is the cause of metabolic syndrome at menopausal transition.
This study was designed to determine the incidence of metabolic syndrome and its various components in premenopausal and postmenopausal women from Punjab.
This study was conducted on 200 females in the age group of 45-60 years attending outpatient department over a period of 2 years in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Bebe Nanki Mother and Child Care Centre, Government Medical College, Amritsar. A detailed history and physical examination were done and recorded on a pro forma. Biochemical assessment comprising fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol was done. Metabolic syndrome was assessed as per the modified NCEP ATP III criteria.
Twenty-nine percent women were found to have newly onset metabolic syndrome, the incidence in premenopausal group was 16%, and in postmenopausal group was 42%. Among the components, the incidence of hypertension (58%) was the highest followed by waist circumference (42%). Maximum correlation of metabolic syndrome was found with high-density lipoprotein (odds ratio - 7.250) followed by waist circumference (odds ratio - 7.111).
The incidence of metabolic syndrome was found to be higher in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. Currently, the need of the hour is lifestyle modification to reduce the emergence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases."

#### Jordan Wilson's theme


Privacy control, hacking and basic database security

###### Theme:
Personal privacy: How can personal information be stolen and what are the consequences of stealing this information?

#### Goals
Generate a model in which students are able to hack a database and to allow them to extract "personal" information from the database. Invite students to discover how this stolen information may easily be stolen and then violate of personal privacy. We will teach basic  hacking of an SQL database to steal this information.

###### Purpose:
To demonstrate how information can be lost by hacking an SQL database. To provide discussion questions about how this information could lead to identity theft and a serious overall personal privacy violation. Provide leading questions to lead students to safe practice when placing information in online databases.

###### TODO, This week
  * Find two or three articles concerning how privacy is lost from hacking databases. We will use this articles to introduce students to the types of problems that exist with bad security. Please take notes on these articles and come prepared to next week to discuss the articles.

  * Find system of hosting a sql database (Flask, Django or similar). Please be sure to research the ease of hosting an SQL database using the software for the class activity. Determine how to use each of these softwares to host a database that will be accessed by the class.  


###### TODO, Next week
* Create interesting "personal" data to be stored in the database. You might want to write a computer program to invent names, credit card numbers, social security numbers, addresses and other personal information. Students will hack-into and steal this information for a class activity.
* Determine some leading questions concerning the negative consequences of a breach of this information. For example: How could this information be used to violate a person's privacy? What can be done to minimize the impact of this information? etc.

* Determine some leading questions concerning security. For example, how could the data be better protected? Where was the failure in the security to protect the data? How to stop breaches in the future?


* Start thinking of a hacking "tutorial" to help students break into the database to steal the synthetic personal information. For this check online resources to learn of common ways of breaking into an SQL database. Can you break your database in the same way? If so, create notes for the students to follow to hack the database and steal information.

Note: in the tutorial, we will need to discuss how hacking is being used teach about security problems and how to make a databases secure (i.e., decisions to make regarding the amount, type of data being held in the database, security, encryption and etc.)

* Determine some leading questions concerning what has been learned in the whole activity. We will design some reflection questions to encourage the students to write their reactions and thoughts on how personal privacy is protected by good security and common-sense decisions about what kinds of information to place into an online database. Similar types of questions to follow.

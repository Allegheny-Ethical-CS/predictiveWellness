# Lab Idea for Web Development

- Create a simple webpage

- Have the students display information about themselves such as Name, Birthday, Major/Minor and a hobby.

- Then have the students also embed a picture of themselves to the webpage.

- In reflection ask students about the ethics of web design
  - What kind of website do you want the world to see?
  - How do you want yourself to be viewed because of this website?
  - How might any website have an impact on someones life?
